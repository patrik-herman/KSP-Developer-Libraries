# KSP-Developer-Libraries
Few own Kontakt KSP developer libraries made public.

### Installation
- Install [SublimeKSP](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP/ "SublimeKSP") by nojanath.
- Download libraries and include them in your .ksp file, in this order:
```
import "dev_intersect.ksp"
import "dev_drag.ksp"
import "dev_canvas.ksp"
```
- Imports are optional. Do take a look at requires of libraries.
- Every library has an **unpacks** section that tells where to initialize every library.
